Creating react App using &lt;script> tags for the react and react dom
Normally users are getting started using create-react-app but it can also be done using <script> tag for React and reactDom.
This is from old versions of React v.15.6
  
The sample will explain :-
1. simple <script> tag inclusion in HTML and write Hello-world.
2. Creating components.
3. Creating nested components and returning them.
4. What are Props and their usage.
5. Event handling for the page.
6. State, how and what it is ?
7. Refs and their usage.
8. Simple comment-board example to aggregate all the concepts.  
9. Life-cycle hooks : componentDidMount()
  
  
There is good tutorial about it from Mr. Buckey Roberts which I followed.
