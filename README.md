Creating react App using &lt;script> tags for the react and react dom
Normally users are getting started using create-react-app but it can also be done using <script> tag for React and reactDom.
This is from old versions of React v.15.6
  
There is good tutorial about it from Mr. Buckey Roberts which I followed.
